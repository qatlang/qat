COMMENTS

The traditional definition of open source is flawed, as it is 
often meant to be "Free and Open Source" instead of just "Open 
Source". And because of that, this license is not compatible 
with the definition of Open Source by the Open Source Initiative 
(OSI). Instead this license follows the true meaning of open 
source, allowing the source to be inspected and verified by the 
public free of cost. However, advertising that this license is 
an Open Source license can lead to ambiguity and confusion. 
Hence we choose to identify this license as belonging to the 
"Shared Source" family of licenses.
