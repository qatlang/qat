`qat` is envisioned to be a superfast, modern systems language for efficient and maintainable code. No, it is not a `C++` Killer. `C++` is the result of half a century of research, engineering, design, effort, optimisations, bugfixes, review and collaboration. Saying that any language can replace it is just a fantasy. The compiler for `qat` is written in `C++`, and that's not without reason.

The source code of the compiler is closed source for now. The compiler will be open sourced, when one of the following happens:

- The language gets enough traction
- The project is recognisable in the developer ecosystem
- The language becomes self hosted

[**Aldrin Mathew**](https://github.com/AldrinMathew) is the creator and sole maintainer of the language.
